						<em>Just ASCII About Me</em> (10 points)</h3>
						<p>Due: <time datetime="2017-01-20">Friday, January 20, 2017</time></p>
						
						<details><summary><strong>Assignment Brief</strong></summary>

						<p class="assignments">Becoming acquainted with web browser developer tools is an important skill in learning how to read markup and navigate HTML and CSS documents. Start making a habit of looking at the source documents for websites that you regularly visit (for example <a class="underline blue-text" href="https://www.craigslist.org/" target="_blank">Craigslist</a>, <a class="underline blue-text" href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a class="underline blue-text" href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, etc.).</p>

						<p class="assignments">Read the following article: Tom McCormack, “<a class="underline blue-text" href="../readings/2013-04apr-30-rhizome-blog-tom-mccormack-emoticon-emoji-text-ii-just-ascii.pdf" target="_blank">Emoticon, Emoji, Text II: Just ASCII</a>,” <cite>Rhizome</cite> (2013).</p>

						<p class="assignments"><a class="underline blue-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art" target="_blank">ASCII art</a> is just one example of information that you can find “hidden” in website markup. Spend at least one hour visiting as many major websites as possible, viewing the source markup in the browser developer tools, and taking note of ASCII marks, logos, art, or other hidden messages in the source comments. ASCII logos are generally found inside of <a class="underline blue-text" href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_comment.asp" target="_blank"><strong class="blue-text">&lt;!-- comment tags --&gt;</strong></a> and often are near the top of the document.</p>

						<p class="assignments">Collect at least two or three (2-3) examples that you find and paste them into a <a class="underline blue-text" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> or <a class="underline blue-text" href="http://www.brackets.io" target="_blank">Brackets</a> HTML document as inspiration and reference. Then, using Brackets or Sublime Text, design three (3) comps of your own ASCII mark as a brand for yourself (do not use an <a class="underline blue-text" href="http://www.network-science.de/ascii/" target="_blank">online ASCII generator</a>; you must design your logos “by hand”). You will include your ASCII mark at the top of all of the website HTML and CSS documents that you create throughtout the semester as a way of “branding” your projects.</p>

						<p class="assignments">Bring three (3) ASCII marks of your personal brand logo printed out on individual sheets at 8.5” x 11” and have them pinned-up and ready for critique at the beginning of class next week (January 20). Based on the feedback that you receive, you will then make any revise and develop one (1) of those logos and have the final iteration printed and pinned-up at the beginning of class the following week (January 27).</p>

						<p class="assignments">Here are a few examples of sites that display ASCII logos, marks, and messages as comments in their source files:</p>

						<p>Due: <time datetime="2017-01-27">Friday, January 27, 2017</time></p>
						
						<details><summary><strong>Assignment Brief</strong></summary>

						<p class="assignments">Sign up for a <a class="underline blue-text" href="https://www.blogger.com/home">Blogger</a>, <a class="underline blue-text" href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, or <a class="underline blue-text" href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> blog and become familiar with using the dashboard controls (<a class="underline blue-text" href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/1623800?hl=en">Blogger</a>, <a class="underline blue-text" href="https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/posting">Tumblr</a>, <a class="underline blue-text" href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/dashboard/">WordPress</a>) by completing the following project: </p>
						
						<p class="assignments"> Write a brief written critique (at least 200 words) of any three (3) websites of your choosing. You may do more, but the minimum is three. Our interest here is not simply to “review” or “rate” these websites, but to carefully consider relationships between form/aesthetic, usability, functionality, and effective visual communication. For each website, ask yourself: What is working about this digital experience and why? What is not working and how could those deficiencies be improved upon?</p>

<p class="assignments">Remember the elements (color, shape, texture, space, form) and principles (unity/harmony, balance, hierarchy, scale/proportion, dominance/emphasis, similarity/contrast) of visual communication. Consider, also, your own understanding and expectations about the conventions and norms of Interaction Design (IxD) and usability: How do you expect a button to look and function? How do you expect menus, forms, and other interactive components to communicate their affordances?</p>

<p class="assignments">Each written critique should be made as a single post on your blog. Each post must also include at least one screengrab of the website in question, and include information about the studio or designer who created the site.</p>

<!-- Take 26 (or more) photos, one of each letter in the alphabet by roaming the streets in your neighborhood. Either find the letters A, B, C, D… Z on signs in your neighborhood or create letters with your own materials. Each image should include a letter. The word “neighborhood” is open for interpretation. 
Post an image of each letter to your blog every hour, for 26 consecutive hours. (Figure out how to automate this task - I do not expect students to stay awake for 26 hours in order to achieve this goal). Post the letters in alphabetical order, either A - Z or backwards (Z - A). Add captions to comment on the photos - where did you find them, what do these images have in common, why do they create a set? Make sure images are sized appropriately for the Web.</p>

						<p class="assignments">Your blog must include at least two additional pages: an “About Me” page, and a “Project Statement” page, which should include a paragraph description explaining your methodologies and what is interesting to you about the collection. Your site must also feature a well-considered title (not just simply: “The Alphabet”).</p> -->

							adjective: meta

    1.
    (of a creative work) referring to itself or to the conventions of its genre; self-referential.


<p>This project involves building a meta website, in other words, a website about the building of websites. In it, you will use the tools that we have covered this semester, and are also welcome to use any other tools you may have encountered or be familiar with that go beyond the scope of what we've been able to do in class.</p>

<p>Your website, when finished, should serve several purposes:<br>

	<ol>
		<li>It will demonstrate and annotate your understanding of the foundational skills and tools of web development covered in this class: HTML5, CSS, and a small amount of javascript / jquery.</li>
		
		<li>It will serve as a kit of parts that you can use to build future websites with, by copying and pasting certain parts of the code, and applying them to whatever designs you may end up making in the future.</li>
		
		<li>It will be something that you can add to in the future as you learn new skills, tools, and techniques</li>
	</ol>
</p>	

<p>Below are listed a number of features that your website must contain, along with point values assigned to each feature. Some of the features are non-negotiable, others are optional, and will increase the point value (and thus the grade) of your site.</p>

						Behind the Screen(grab)s (20 points)</h3>
						<p>Due: <time datetime="2017-04-14">Friday, April 14, 2017</time></p>
						
						<details><summary><strong>Assignment Brief</strong></summary>
						
						<p class="assignments">The components of Responsive Web Design (RWD) – a flexible grid of modular elements, viewport appropriate image resolution, and CSS3 @media Rule breakpoints – are typically used to generate fluid, adaptable page layouts that can accomodate any display without compromising content or usability. However, the CSS3 @media rule also suggests an unconventional means of layering content in the display – the resizing of the browser window itself becomes a way for the user to control and navigate media on the page.</p>

						<p class="assignments">Use the CSS3 @media Rule to create a website that captures and redisplays a curated selection of screens that you interact with on a daily basis. This might conceivably include your laptop or desktop screen, your mobile or smart device screen, and <strong>at least ten</strong> additional display screens (television screen display, digital watch screen, alarm clock screen, microwave screen, parking garage ticket dispenser screen, pedestrian walk signal, METRO TAP card dispenser screen, ATM screen, elevator screen, thermostat screen, printer or XEROX machine screen, coffee shop credit card payment display screen, movie theater screen, your friend's mobile device screen, etc.).</p>

						<p class="assignments">As much as possible, use the screengrab function of the device to capture these screen interactions – otherwise, take a picture of the screen to use as a reference to recreate it digitally. Do your best to estimate the display size of the screen in question (whether in pixels, inches, feet, etc.) when creating your own respresentation.</p>

						<p class="assignments">Consider the organizing logic that the sequence of displays suggests. Does the sequence only reflect certain types of interactions that you have with displays? Does it start to tell a story about your daily rituals and routines? Could you insert text, captions, or links to control the pacing? What is a screen, anyway? Does a screen have to be just digital? Could a tree be a screen? Could a person be a screen? Could a building be a screen? Or could you manipulate the order of devices displayed to better capture a narrative or experiential journey? Is the audience or website user involved or implicated in the interactions being depicted?</p>

						<p class="assignments"><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp" target="_blank">Typical display sizes</a>:</p>
